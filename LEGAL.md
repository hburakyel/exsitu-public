# Legal & Licensing Clarification

## Nature of the Project
Ex Situ is a software-based indexing and research infrastructure.
It does not claim ownership over any external data, collections, or content.

The system operates by indexing publicly accessible institutional hyperlinks
and resolving limited descriptive metadata for research and analytical purposes.

## Data Handling
- Ex Situ does **not** store or redistribute collection datasets
- No copyrighted images or media assets are hosted
- All references resolve back to the original institutional sources
- Metadata is processed solely for indexing and research use

## Linking & Attribution
Ex Situ functions as a discovery layer.
All attribution, authority, and collection context remain with the source institutions.

## Software License
The Ex Situ codebase is licensed under the
**GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0)**.

AGPL is used to ensure that improvements made to publicly accessible
deployments of the software remain available to the commons.

## Intent
Ex Situ is developed to support transparency, research, and interoperability
in the cultural heritage ecosystem, without extracting, enclosing,
or commercializing institutional data.

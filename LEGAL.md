# Legal & Licensing Clarification

## Nature of the Project
Ex Situ is a software-based indexing and research infrastructure.
It does not claim ownership over any external data, collections, or content.

The system operates by indexing publicly accessible institutional hyperlinks
and resolving limited descriptive metadata for research and analysis purposes.

## Data Handling
- Ex Situ does **not** store or redistribute collection datasets
- No copyrighted images or media assets are hosted
- All references resolve back to the original institutional sources
- Metadata is processed solely for indexing and research use

## Linking & Attribution
Ex Situ functions as a discovery layer.
All traffic, attribution, and authority remain with the source institutions.

Linking to publicly available webpages does not constitute republication
or redistribution of content.

## Software License
The Ex Situ codebase is licensed under the
**GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0)**.

AGPL is used to ensure that improvements made to publicly accessible
deployments of the software remain available to the commons.

### What AGPL Requires
- If the Ex Situ software is modified and deployed as a public service,
  the modified source code must be made available to users of that service.

### What AGPL Does NOT Require
- It does not require institutions to open their datasets
- It does not impose obligations on linked or indexed content
- It does not affect the licenses of external data sources

## Institutional Use
Institutions and research groups are free to:
- Run unmodified versions of Ex Situ
- Deploy private or public instances
- Ingest and analyze their own metadata
- Maintain full control over their collections and data policies

Only modifications to the Ex Situ software itself,
when deployed publicly, fall under AGPL obligations.

## Intent
Ex Situ is developed to support transparency, research, and interoperability
in the cultural heritage ecosystem, without extracting, enclosing,
or commercializing institutional data.

# About Ex Situ

Ex Situ is a **research-oriented, commons-driven geospatial infrastructure**
designed to support provenance, spatial, and cross-collection analysis of
cultural heritage data.

The project functions as a **Relational Spatial Index**:
it resolves fragmented institutional hyperlinks into a unified,
machine-readable spatial layer that can be explored, queried, and reused.

Ex Situ is **not** an archive, collection mirror, or data host.
It is an indexing and discovery layer built to increase transparency,
interoperability, and research access across otherwise siloed systems.

## What Ex Situ Does
- Indexes **public institutional hyperlinks**
- Resolves textual provenance references into spatial coordinates
- Enables large-scale spatial analysis and visualization
- Directs all users **back to the source institutions**

## What Ex Situ Does Not Do
- Does not host or redistribute museum collection data
- Does not copy or store copyrighted images
- Does not replace institutional databases or APIs
- Does not function as a centralized repository

## Commons Orientation
Ex Situ is developed as part of a broader effort to build a
**Spatial Digital Commons**:
an ecosystem where cultural heritage data can be studied across institutions
without extraction, enclosure, or platform lock-in.

The project is designed to be **self-hostable**, **transparent**, and
extensible by researchers, institutions, and independent collectives.

## Status
The public interface serves as a **reference implementation** of the
underlying infrastructure. Active development focuses on performance,
interoperability, and open geospatial standards.
